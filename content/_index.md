# Yassine Kachrad

### Master's student in Computer Science at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/)


**Hi!** I am Yassine, a first year MSCS student at [CMU](https://www.cmu.edu/). 
I previously completed my BSc at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/). 


I enjoy working on low latency systems, and more generally anything related to systems and 
networks. I am also deeply interested in cryptocurrencies, blockchain, AI, and financial
markets.

I previously interned at [Codeium](https://codeium.com/), where I mostly worked on backend 
infrastructure and internal tooling.
     
I grew up in Morocco up until I started university.
